                Education is linked to decreasing recidivism where Kate Cauley states that
                 â€œinmates who participate in correctional education programs had 43 percent lower odds of recidivating than those who did not."

                <strong>Recidivism is the act of repeating or recommitting a crime after already committing one before.</strong> Decreasing recidivism is 
                important so that incarcerated people can leave prison and change their lives after, rather than falling back into crime.

                According to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26507622"> Nally et al</a>, recidivism is higher for adults with less than a high 
                school diploma.

                If education is so important, then we need to <strong>stop defunding schools, and instead prioritize public education!</strong> It could 
                keep more people out of jail, and make our country better for all.
